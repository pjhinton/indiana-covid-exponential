This repository contains code needed to reproduce the simple exponential model that I tweeted:

This is not a rigorous model. It was intended to raise awareness of how the infection rates may grow in Indiana if behaviors remain unchanged.  People still don't seem to grasp how awful exponential growth can be.

It was generated by regressing the seven-day moving average of COVID-19 case counts from October 12, 2020 to November 10, 2020.  The Excel spreadsheet was retrieved from the Indiana Data Hub at 3:12 pm EST on November 11, 2020.

I used Python 3.7.9, running on Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS, with the package versions cited in `requirements.txt`, as my Jupyter notebook kernel.
